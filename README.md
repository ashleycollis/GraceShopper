# GraceShopper

A sample ecommerce website where users can create an account, browser items, add to cart and checkout. The main technologies used are React, Redux, Sequelize, Express and PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Run `npm install`
createdb boilermaker
createdb boilermaker-test

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

## Running the tests

* By default, running `npm test` will use `boilermaker-test`, while
  regular development uses `boilermaker`
